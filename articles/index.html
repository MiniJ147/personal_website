<div><a href="/articles/cpu-utilization-case-study/" title="In this article, we take a relatively simple looking LeetCode problem, Magic Squares in Grid,
and proceed to preform numerous optimization techniques on O(n^2) solutions. 
In doing this, we show that by understanding CPU utilization and cache memory you can achieve up to a 375x speedup,
taking a (10^4 x 10^4) matrix process time from 11 minutes down to 1.6 seconds.">Magic Squares in Grid: CPU Utilization Case Study</a>: January 10, 2026</div>
<div><a href="/articles/cpu-utilization/" title="When learning how to write efficient code a critical step is ensuring the most optimal usage of your CPU.
In this article we will discuss how programmers can take advantage of modern CPU's to the fullest extent
by maximizing the usage of their CPU.">Understanding Efficient CPU Utilization</a>: December 28, 2025</div>
<div><a href="/articles/multicore-memory/" title="Understanding Memory is a very critical aspect in writing efficient programs (Sequential or Parallel). 
In a multicore system, however, it gets significantly more complicated and important. 
This article is a presentation of my knowledge of computer memory 
and my attempt to condense this knowledge into a easy to digest format.">Memory in a Multicore Context (WIP)</a>: December 21, 2025</div>
