        <h1>Hello<sub style="font-size: medium;">Mini,</sub></h1>
        <div>
            My name is Jake.<br>
            I really<sub>1</sub>+ really<sub>2</sub> ... really<sub>n-1</sub>+ really<sub>n</sub> enjoy computer science
            (but mostly software topics).<br>
            I also like math, but thats a work in progress.<br><br>
            Currently, Im in my second year of undergraduate studies attempting to pursue a Masters in Computer Science
            and minor in
            Math.

        <h1>My Interests</h1>
        <p>
            I love network programming so much, making computers talking to one another is the coolest thing to me.<br>
            I also love concurrency and parallelism as the topics and problems encountered are so incredibly complex and
            interesting.<br><br>

            Because of these 2 strong interest I'am heavily considering a career in Distributed Systems with plans for
            that to be my specialty in my Master program.
            Of course, Im only still in my second year and have a lot more to learn about everything listed above if I
            wanna get a job in this field.
        </p>

        <div>
            As of 2025 heres a list of my major interests:
            <ul>
                <li>Networking</li>
                <li>Parallelism & Concurrency</li>
                <li>Distributed Systems</li>
                <li>Databases & Backend Development</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <section id="books">
            <h2>Books</h2>
            I like to try and take my time through books. Not only do I practice with exercises and dive deep into the
            topics Im just a slow reader. So, you know, it takes me a while. <br>
