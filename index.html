        <h1>Hello<sub style="font-size: medium;">Mini,</sub></h1>
        <div>
            My name is Jake.<br>
            I really enjoy <strong>computer science</strong> and <strong>research</strong>.<br>
            I'm also interested in applied Math for Computer Science: proving algorithms/computation problems.<br><br>

            Currently, Im in my third year of undergraduate studies with the goal of pursing a PhD in Computer Science studying Concurrency/Parallelism.<br><br>
            My main goal is to become a researcher at a national lab or full-time professor.

        <h1>My Interests</h1>
        <p>
            I enjoy Concurrency / Parallel Computing, Data-Structure and Algorithms, HPC, and Distributed Computing.<br><br>
            I really enjoy hearing about others research ventures, reading papers, and deep talks about topics in Computer Science.<br><br>
            I'm also attempting to work with more electrical projects, but I lack any interesting ideas to begin exploring. <br><br>
            I used to enjoy software engineering, but I've realized my true passion lives in research. So, I have taken a break from searching and exploring 
            software engineering roles in industry

        Collection of my projects in no particular order. A lot of projects weren't included here just for the sake of
        saving space and me forgetting a lot of them.
